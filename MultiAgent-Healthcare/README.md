# AutoMed: AI Agents for Healthcare Assistance
![ImageAutoGen](autogen.png)

**Platform**: IBM Cognitive Class – Guided Project  
**Framework**: AG2 (AutoGen) Multi-Agent Framework

---

## Overview

AutoMed is a project built using the AG2 (AutoGen) multi-agent framework, designed to simulate basic medical assistance using AI. Instead of a single chatbot, AutoMed uses multiple AI agents that each perform a specific task—such as analyzing symptoms, suggesting treatments, and retrieving reliable medical information.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how multiple AI agents can work together to handle user health-related questions and deliver relevant, personalized responses.

> **Note**: This is an educational project only. The medical responses generated should not be treated as real medical advice.

## What I Learned

By completing this guided project, I learned how to:

- Use AG2 to build multi-agent systems
- Create and coordinate multiple AI agents
- Handle basic user input about health symptoms
- Design agents that can fetch relevant medical information
- Simulate real-time healthcare assistance using large language models (LLMs)

---

## Key Components

- **Symptom Intake Agent**: Accepts user symptoms and formats them for processing.
- **Treatment Suggestion Agent**: Suggests common treatments based on the input.
- **Medical Info Agent**: Retrieves health-related content from trusted sources.
- **Coordinator Agent**: Passes data between agents and assembles the final response.

## Sample Interaction

> **User Input**: I have a sore throat, slight fever, and feel tired.

**System Output** (example):
- Based on your symptoms, this could be a viral infection.
- Suggested treatments: rest, drink plenty of fluids, consider taking paracetamol.
- If symptoms worsen or persist, please consult a medical professional.
- Here’s more information from Mayo Clinic on sore throats: [link]

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand the basics of building collaborative AI systems for a real-world use case. The structured flow between agents made it easier to break down complex questions and simulate meaningful health responses.
