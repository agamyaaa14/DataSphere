# AI Paris Travel Guide (PlanningTripOpenAI)

## Overview

This project demonstrates using a large language model (LLM) to build an intelligent, conversational Paris travel guide. Rather than focusing on engineering details, the work emphasizes how an LLM can be used as a thinking partner to answer travel questions, create personalized recommendations, and turn user preferences into practical itineraries.

## What you'll learn

- How to design prompts and conversations so an LLM gives useful, structured travel advice.
- How to translate user constraints (time, budget, interests, mobility) into prioritized recommendations.
- How to extract and summarize local context (neighborhood highlights, transit tips, opening hours) from text and knowledge sources.
- Skills exercised: prompt engineering, conversational design, user-centered reasoning, evaluation of model outputs (accuracy, relevance, safety), and cost-awareness when using APIs.

## Why it matters

Travel advice is not just factual: it's personalized, contextual, and often subjective. The LLM acts as a human-like assistant that can synthesize diverse inputs (preferences, constraints, place knowledge) into actionable suggestions—useful for prototyping concierge services, trip planners, or interactive travel learning tools.
