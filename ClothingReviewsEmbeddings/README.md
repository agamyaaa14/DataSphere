# Clothing Reviews — Semantic Embeddings Project

## Overview

This project analyzes customer feedback from the "Women’s Clothing E‑Commerce Reviews" dataset to surface themes, sentiment, and semantic patterns. The focus is on transforming raw reviews into meaning: categorizing feedback into themes, building embeddings for semantic search, and using similarity methods to discover recurring issues or highlight standout comments.

## What this project teaches

- How to think about text as data: cleaning, grouping, and interpreting customer voice.
- Building and using vector embeddings to power semantic search and similarity queries.
- Designing lightweight pipelines for extracting aspects (fit, quality, shipping, returns) and associated sentiment.
- Skills exercised: exploratory data analysis, prompt/design for NLU tasks, embedding-based retrieval, and communicating findings for product or support teams.

## Why it matters

E‑commerce reviews carry rich, actionable insights that ratings alone miss. Embeddings let you find semantically similar feedback (even when different words are used), prioritize recurring problems, and summarize customer needs—helping product owners and support teams respond faster and smarter.
