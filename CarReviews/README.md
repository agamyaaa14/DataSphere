# Car Reviews — Project Overview

## Overview

This project explores how people talk about cars: the language they use, the emotions behind their reviews, and the signals that indicate satisfaction or concern. Rather than being a how-to, this repository is a compact exploration of understanding consumer voice in text and what that understanding enables.

## What this project teaches

- How to interpret and reason about unstructured feedback (text) from customers.
- How to identify themes, sentiment, and common pain points in product reviews.
- How to translate qualitative language into quantitative signals for decision making.
- Skills exercised: critical data reading, exploratory thinking, feature intuition, basic NLP understanding, and communicating insights clearly.

## How this project works

At its core this project uses a large language model (LLM) to read and reason about car reviews. The notebook shows examples of how an LLM can be used to:

- Summarize long or noisy reviews into concise themes.
- Extract aspects (e.g., reliability, fuel economy, comfort) and associated sentiments.
- Group similar complaints or praises to surface recurring issues.
- Generate human-readable recommendations and prioritized action items from the text.

The emphasis is on using the LLM as an analytical partner: it accelerates interpretation and helps transform high-volume feedback into clear, actionable insights.

## Why it matters

Customer reviews are a direct line to user experience. Mining them reveals recurring problems, feature requests, and emotional cues that surveys or ratings alone may miss. This project is about turning language into action: informing product improvements, customer support priorities, or market positioning.
